Goal: Make a great writing experience that will make you type for longer periods

Features: 
- Sleak Interface {DONE}
- Minamilist Design [DONE]

TODO:
- Timer for how long you've been typing and when you stop for 10 seconds, it will reset to 0 [DONE]
- A mode where if you stopped for 10 seconds everything will be erased so you force yourself to write for a certain period of time
- ^^ I will call it (Write Or die)
- This mode will be activated once he clicks the button in the header (default will be 10 minutes)
- he can change the minutes in the settings i think
(Write or die mode have been done)

Next is the visual effects and code cleaning and organizing, it's pretty messy here 


-- oh no i've been playing with styles for 10m , next is i think a progress bar for the time remaining in the WriteOrDie mode

okay the progress bar is working completely fine but the code is REALLY really a big mess so i need to do some cleaning tho

okay now let's see i'll be doing something like a landing page , explaining the website and the idea behind it 

it's working great now but need lots and lots of edits but it's not buggy at least
