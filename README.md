## Flow Typing

It's an app designed to motivate you to type as much as you can and to enter the flow state, where you write directly from your brain without delay.

Make sure to visit: [Flow Typing](https://flow-typing.vercel.app/)

I used:
- Next.js  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Framer Motion  
- next-themes  

### Features
- Write Or Die: When activated, if you stopped for 10s you will lose all of your prorgress so be careful:
- Minimal Design: the design is miniaml so you can focus only on coding
- /info page: this will help you understand more about the project


### How to run the project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
