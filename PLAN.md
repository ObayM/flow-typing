Goal: Make a great writing experience that will make you type for longer periods

Features: 
- Sleak Interface {DONE}
- Minamilist Design [DONE]

TODO:
- Timer for how long you've been typing and when you stop for 10 seconds, it will reset to 0 [DONE]
- A mode where if you stopped for 10 seconds everything will be erased so you force yourself to write for a certain period of time
- ^^ I will call it (Write Or die)
- This mode will be activated once he clicks the button in the header (default will be 10 minutes)
- he can change the minutes in the settings i think
(Write or die mode have been done)

Next is the visual effects and code cleaning and organizing, it's pretty messy here 


git add .
git commit -m "Added the write or die mode which if it's activated you have to type for 10 minutes without stopping for more than 10 seconds, that forces you to get into the flow state"
git push
